# lattice

A hobbyist project exploring generative art while learning Rust and
[nannou][nannou-link].

## Overview

This project aims to port my [p5.js project][p5-link] to Rust for improved
performance. It provides a personal framework around nannou that simplifies
creating multiple sketches by handling common concerns like window creation, GUI
controls, and declarative frame-based animation.

## Features / TODO

- [x] Export frame captures and generate MP4 videos for any sketch
- [x] Restart frame counter when receiving MIDI start signal
- [x] Queue frame/video recording to start when receiving MIDI Start message
- [x] Receive MIDI enable parameter automation via automation lanes (MIDI CC)
- [x] Common controls system:
- [x] Shared controls available to all sketches (screenshot, pause, record,
      etc.)
- [x] Declarative per-sketch control definitions with frameword agnostic design
- [x] BPM/musical timing based keyframe animations (times are expressed in
      beats)
- [x] Automatic store/recall of GUI control/parameters
- [x] Audio reactivity. Basic peak, rms, and FFT available to use in sketches
      through a dead simple API
- [ ] Multichannel audio

## Status

The project is under active development. Basic animation features are working,
with more functionality planned.

## Requirements

This project has been developed on MacOS, though I'm sure most of it would work
on other platforms. This project requires or optionally needs:

- Rust
- Git LFS for screenshot storage (perhaps this is optional? I'm not too familiar
  with Git LFS but I'm using it for this so you might want to too)
- (optional) [just][just-link] for running commands
- (optional) ffmpeg available on your path for video exports

## Usage

### Creating a new sketch:

1. Copy the [template sketch][template-link] into a new file in sketches folder.
2. Rename at a minimum the `SKETCH_CONFIG.name` field at the top of the file:
   ```rust
   pub const SKETCH_CONFIG: SketchConfig = SketchConfig {
      name: "template", // <-- RENAME THIS!
   ```
3. Add that filename to the [sketches module][module-link]
4. Add a match case for the sketch in [src/main.rs][main-link]:
   ```rust
   "my_awesome_sketch" => run_sketch!(my_awesome_sketch),
   ```
5. Run that sketch via command line by `cargo run --release <name>` or
   `just start <name>` where `name` is what you put in your file's
   `SKETCH_CONFIG.name` field.

### Audio

Lattice is hardcoded to read audio from the first input (input 1, or index 0, or
left channel) on a device named "Lattice". I am currently doing this via
Aggregate Device on my Mac using [Blackhole 2ch][blackhole] to capture output
from DAW. Here are some screenshots of the setup:

**Aggregate Device Setup**

**Routing Audio to Blackhole 2ch `Out(3/4):In(1/2)`**

> Note that Blackhole automatically routes whatever its output channels are to
> its own input, so sending audio out to Blackhole 3/4 will automatically appear
> on inputs 1/2 in this setup; you don't even need to configure the inputs in
> Ableton at all for this to work (just as long as you have the output config
> set to "Lattice" and enable the appropriate ouputs in the output config under
> Live's audio preferences)

### MIDI

Lattice is hardcoded to accept MIDI on a virtual MIDI device that must be named
`IAC Driver Lattice In`.

### MIDI Loopback

To control synth parameters in Ableton and Lattice parameters simultaneously,
you need to enable MIDI loopback by sending MIDI to `Lattice In` and also route
`Lattice In` back in to Live to control parameters. Here's the routing:

![Live MIDI Preferences](assets/live-midi-prefs.png)

To use Ableton automation lanes to control Lattice params, follow these steps:

1. Create a MIDI track and clip and add CC automation to it.
2. In the tracks **MIDI To** router, select `IAC Driver Lattice In` and `Ch. 1`

Those steps are all you need to send MIDI to Lattice to control parameters. As
for controlling a live parameter with that same CC, follow these steps:

1. Play your clip containing the CC data
2. Stop the transport (this is important!)
3. Enter MIDI Mapping mode.
4. Locate the parameter to you want to map and select it (make sure it's the
   last thing you've clicked)
5. Press the Space bar to start the transport. This should do it!

See the [midi_test.rs sketch][midi-sketch-link] for an example of how to map a
control to something.

> Note: the above instructions are for working without a MIDI controller. When
> working with a MIDI controller you can just map the MIDI control to an Ableton
> device knob that can send CC out to Lattice and also map the controller to an
> Ableton parameter. In this case _you do not_ want Lattice enabled in Ableton's
> MIDI Input ports at all as that just complicates things.

#### Sync Recording

1. In Ableton > Preferences > Record, make sure **Start Transport With Record**
   is set to **Off**
2. Hit **Q Rec** in Lattice.
3. Arm tracks in Ableton, arm the transport (Record button)
4. Now, pressing play in Ableton will also initiate recording in Lattice,
   likewise pressing Stop in Ableton will stop recording in Lattice.
