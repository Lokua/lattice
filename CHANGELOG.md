# v0.1.0 (2025.04.05)

Just now adding a changelog. For changes between November of 2024 and now you
must consult the commit history, but overall at this point we have:

- Built an entire framework around Nannou
- Moved from EGUI for UI to using React/Typescript in a WebView rendered with
  Tao and Wry which has provided amazing UI flexibility at the cost of added
  complexity
- Per sketch MIDI, OSC, UI, and Audio Controls via the ControlHub struct with
  disk persistence
- A live "scripting" mechanism for all controls and animations with
  hot-reloading via ControlHub featuring parameter modulation (use sliders or
  animations to control the parameters of other animations and effects - crazy)
- A comprehensive musical-timing based animation suite featuring DAW-style
  automation breakpoints with complex curves like ramps, random, random smooth,
  and various synth-style waveforms that can amplitude modulated
- Shader support with various templates to get up and running quickly
- A somewhat advanced yet undocumented `uniforms` proc-macro to ease the
  boilerplate of creating wgsl vec4 uniform "banks" and having to manually
  initialize them and pass them to the shader
- Ability to MIDI map controllers to sliders in the UI aka "MIDI learn"
- Capture up to 10 snapshots of all parameters on a per-sketch basis; snapshots
  are linearly interpolated from/to at an adjustable beat-based duration
- Global persistence of MIDI, OSC, and audio ports selectable in the UI's
  Settings View.
- Ability to randomize all sketch parameters via Cmd+R (POC - need to integrate
  this with the snapshot system)
